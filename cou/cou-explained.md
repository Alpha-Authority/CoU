# CoU Explained

## Your Personal Guide

### The Core

The Code of Unification \(CoU\) is a living document. It holds a list of guidelines which enforce order and protect those who uphold the CoU.

### Trust the Code

As designed to support the full operation of Alpha Authority, the CoU is only as good as the trust that people give into it. By following the regulations, or rules, or guidelines you could call it by, you follow a path that has no means of breaking the rules stated in the CoU. The Code is your sword and shield, enabling you to act upon your duties, as well as be protected from corrupt entities. Trust the CoU, it's here for your aid.

### Recalling the Code

Although it can seem like a lot to carry, throughout time and participation, you'll be able to recall your roles pretty easily, even as you progress through the ranks. The Code of Unification is wrote in simple terms. Interpreting the code in anyway other than how it is wrote, does risk disciplinary action for any user.

### Reading & Updates

With all that said, continue into the next sections in any order. Just be sure to read all of them, and check back occasionally for any changes. Rest assured, Alpha Authority's reign will send everyone a notification when there is a change to the CoU \(See Comm. Section\).
