## November 9th, 2019

A few interesting ideas brought up in 2018 under the Alpha Authority administration were in part to make Alpha Authority unlike any clan out there.

In reference to some of the technological feats in ROBLOX's history, we started to develop a new system and hierarchy for the group itself.

It went as:

* Alpha Authority owning a site which:
  * was a host for: 
    * Player Rankings & Leaderboard for: \(All time/Yearly/Seasons\)
      * Skill Statistics
      * Kills/Deaths/Damage
      * Involvement
        * Events
        * Special Events
        * Tournaments
          * Team Status
          * Past
      * Group Rank
    * Announcements
      * News
    * Tournaments

      -

    * Staff Only Access to
      * Logs

    * Allowed players to verify their roblox account with, and view their skill scores,
* In-Game Infrastructure
  * Game Economy
    * Food

    * Multiple Consoles
    * Ranking
  * Automated Skill Identification & Ranking

Hierarchy that:
